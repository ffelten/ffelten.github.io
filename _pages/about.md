I am a PhD Student in the [PCOG](https://pcog.uni.lu/) group at the University of Luxembourg. My current research interests are Multi-Objective Optimization, Reinforcement Learning, and Swarm applications. I am currently working on Automating the Design of Autonomous Robot Swarms ([ADARS](https://adars.uni.lu/)) project, under the supervision of [Gr√©goire Danoy](https://danoy.gforge.uni.lu/).

I am convinced that specifying AI problems as single-objective is often not enough since we often make compromises in real-life situations. To me, the fact that most our current flagship applications in such an advanced field as AI are single-objective is appalling.

Before my PhD, I specialized into combinatorial optimization techniques such as Constraint Programming, Local search, Meta-heuristics algorithms. I worked a few years in the industry on supply chain optimization, planning problems, and have been exposed to various software engineering challenges. 

Aside from the cool things mentionned above, I am into cinema, cycling, and beers (yes, I am Belgian).

## A suite for reproducible research in MORL
With [Lucas](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~lnalegre/), we wrote two repositories aiming at helping researcher in reproducing results of existing MORL algorithms, as well as facilitate the whole research process by providing clean implementations and examples. By making this public, our hope is to attract even more people to the MORL field as well as remove boilerplate from the research process. 

### MO-Gym

[mo-gym](https://github.com/LucasAlegre/mo-gym) is a library containing multiple multi-objective RL environments. These environments are all under a standardized API, allowing to test your algorithms on multiple benchmarks without the need to change your code.  


### MORL-baselines

[morl-baselines](https://github.com/LucasAlegre/morl-baselines) is a repository containing multiple MORL algorithms using mo-gym. We aim to provide clean, reliable and validated implementations as well as tools to help in the development of such algorithms.
