I am PhD Student in the [PCOG](https://pcog.uni.lu/) group at the University of Luxembourg. My current research interests are Multi-Objective Optimization, Reinforcement Learning, and Swarm applications. I am currently working on Automating the Design of Autonomous Robot Swarms ([ADARS](https://adars.uni.lu/)) project, under the supervision of [Gr√©goire Danoy](https://danoy.gforge.uni.lu/).

<em>The consequences of learning multiple behaviours, based on different trade-offs in the objectives</em>



Before my PhD, I specialized into combinatorial optimization techniques such as Constraint Programming, Local search, Meta-heuristics algorithms. I worked a few years in the industry on supply chain optimization, planning problems, and have been exposed to various software engineering challenges. 

Aside from the cool things mentionned above, I am into cinema, cycling, and beers (yes, I am Belgian).
