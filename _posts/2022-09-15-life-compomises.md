* Life is made of compromises
* Time vs money (grows as a curve, under the curve is inefficient over the curve is very unusual)
* We can run multiple life scenarios, with various hours per week people work, and get their monthly salary
* A PhD (yours truly) is generally under the curve, and a Billionaire is probably well over the curve.
* The idea is that you have a choice in your life: no, you are not forced to work 40 hours a week because "it is standard". That's BS. And this choice should be guided by your preferences. The trick is, that every person has different preferences.

* In general, in <AI, optimization, ML, whatever_current_buzzword> what we do is we simplify the problem by setting preferences a priori. For example, if I have 10 points to assign between all criteria, I can put 7 on money, and 3 on hours. After running my scenario, I end up with 35 hours a week, for a salary of 2000€ a month, enough to live and some free time for me. 
* Now, the problem is that sometimes, the curve is not that simple. Let's say we include taxes (concave part), well it seems that after 1800€/month, I get into another tax category, and I earn less per additional hours. In that case, I can instead work 32 hours a week for 1800€ per month, which corresponds to 6 points on money, and 4 on hours. The problem with the a priori of approach is that you don't see it, since you never looked into other scenarios. That's the whole purpose of the a posteriori approach, where we output the curve, instead of a point, to the user. 
* Now it comes with drawbacks too. Of course, analyzing those scenarios takes more time than only considering one, and usually you have more than 2 criteria to consider: what about family time, fulfilment, ethics, etc?
