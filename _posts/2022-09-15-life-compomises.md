Now that I look cultivated with my citation, I might have one or two things to develop on the matter. As an optmization fan, I am constantly identifying situations where we could be more efficient, this post is about the efficiency of decisions. 

Decisions in life are very often subject to compromises. For example, in our society, one has to trade its time for money - we usually refer to that as "working". 

To optimize such choices, what we usually do is observe multiple life scenarios and their outcomes. Here, I will use data generated by my imagination for the sake of the example, but be assured that it is close to what we do in AI or optimization. So, my data are average salaries per month, based on the working hours per week of a person. Here is what it looks like in a table:


| Hours of work | Avg. Salary | 
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 200 |
| ...Â | ... |
| 35 | 1800 |
| 40 | 2000 |
| ... | ...Â |
| 60 | 3000 |
| 80 | 4000 | 

In a graph, the data would look like this:

![working_graph](working.png "The work-life balance trade-offs.")

Naturally, you can see in the graph that the more time you spend working, the more money you can expect. So far, the data seem logical and everything makes sense. Notice that I have drawn two zones also in the graph. The red one is the inefficient zone; it means that if you are in that zone, well friend you work too much for your salary (this is typically where a PhD student lies ðŸ«¢). The green zone is the unusually good zone, it means that you are overpaid for the hours you do. You can think of a billionaire for the latter.

In the middle, we can observe a curve. That curve is the efficiency zone: whenever you are on a point on that zone, it is impossible to increase one criteria, without sacrifying in the other. For example, you cannot earn more without working more, and you cannot work less without losing salary. This concept is called Pareto efficiency by the economists and guys like me.

Well now the news is that as long as you stay on that curve, no point is objectively better than the other. That means a person working 20 hours a week for 1000â‚¬ is not "better" or "worse" than a person working 40 for 2000â‚¬. This precise thing illustrates one of the many compromises we have to make in life.

Here is what science says: the point which is optimal depends on the **person's preferences**. So, yes, earning less money than your neighbour can be optimal for you, if you prefer more free time. And no, working full-time just "because everyone does" is not necessarily what suits you best.

Now, our job in `<AI, Optimization, Machine Learning, *insert current buzzword*>` is to find the best possible points. So our job is to find that curve! 

To make problem simpler, we often set preferences before running the scenarios (*a priori*). This allows us to concentrate on precise regions. For example, by setting 10 points between the two criteria, I can specify a preference. For example, say 7 for money, and 3 for time. After going through the scenario, I find the life choice of 35 hours per week for 1800â‚¬ per month. 

Well, the problem is that sometimes, the curve is not that simple, and we don't see it. Let's say we include taxes to our scenarios, the taxes are applies when people reach a minimum living wage, say 1500â‚¬ per month. In that world, my preferences would lead me to 35 hours a week, for 1600â‚¬ per month. This is quite different from the previous situation, isn't it?

The alternative is to systematically present the various optimal choices to the person. In such case, I could show them that for 32 hours a week, they could make 1500â‚¬ (just before the taxes apply). This is what we call the *a posteriori* method, because the person states its preferences after the optimization is run. This is what I do in my research: I look for various compromises when controlling drones on missions, for criterias, you can think of battery usage, speed, risk, predictability. 

Obviously, this approach comes with drawbacks, too. Analyzing more scenarios implies more efforts and takes more time, for a machine or for a human... But also, we often have more than two criteria to consider: what about family time, fulfilment, ethics, etc?
