We introduce MO-Gym, an extensible library containing a diverse set of multi-objective reinforcement learning environments. It introduces a standardized API that facilitates conducting experiments and performance analyses of algorithms designed to interact with multiobjective Markov decision processes. Importantly, it extends the widely used OpenAI Gym API, allowing the reuse of algorithms and features that are well-established in the reinforcement learning community. MO-Gym is available at: https://github.com/LucasAlegre/mo-gym.
