Railway traffic scheduling is a problem that affects a lot of people in their everyday life. While
designing efficient train schedules is already a challenge in itself, it is already well solved.
However, small perturbations in the traffic can have a big impact on the initial timetable and
cause disproportionate delays.
Rescheduling and rerouting trains in these situations help limiting the impact of the initial
perturbations. Constraint programming is an efficient programming paradigm when it comes
to scheduling problems. In this thesis, the focus is placed on rescheduling using constraint
programming models built with conditional time-interval variables. Firstly, an implementation
of these variables is given for OscaR, which yields promising results. Secondly, some additions
are proposed to existing models that target this problem. Finally, the performances of the new
model are assessed on fictive data using CP Optimizer and compared to classical approaches.
The tests have been realised on multiple Belgian stations and with scenarios of different levels of
complexity. The results show that the model gives better performances than greedy approaches
(generally used by the railway operators) in almost all the situations.
